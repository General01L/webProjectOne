            <h3>Space Hulk</h3>
            <p>A space hulk can be one or multiple lost space ships smashed into each other by the turmoil of the warp.</p>
            <p>Although warp travel offers the fastest way of traveling between distant stars, its turbulant nature makes it possible that some ships never arrive at their final destination.</p>
            <p>This can be caused by anything, leaving the warp and translating inside another ship, the ship being seized by the forces of the warp, crew madness, failing warp engines....or other infestations.</p>
            <p>In the end this process can result in space hulks, which can appear anywhere in the galaxy at any time. When this happens many factions send out their forces to claim, destroy or explore these hulks for relics, sports or...dark secrets.</p>

            <h3>In darkness</h3>
            <p>In the darkness they gather, in large numbers they come, relentless and endless they are, many of these space hulks are infested with a xenos race known as the Tyranids.</p>
            <p>The infestations aboard space hulks often involve lower life forms of the Tyranid race, while this means that there is no threat of a giant coordinated army being aboard one of these, they are still extremely dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Relics</h3>
            <p>So why do many factions wish to board these hulks even if the only thing that awaits them is death?</p>
            <p>Relics, wargear and other valuable artifacts are often aboard these space hulks. Since time and space work differently in the warp a lost space ship could be from the past or the future. This means that lost technology or new technology might be found aboard a space hulk.</p>
            <p>Of course some races do not hunt for treasure or items that they can resell on the intergalactic market. Some races simply come to destroy or just for the fun of fighting. And some...some come for the darkness.....</p>

            <h3>The Warp</h3>
            <p>A realm where time and space have gone mad. Full of deamons, traitors and dark gods. The warp is the most evil and twisted place in existence. While warp travel might be the fastest way of travel available to most races of the 41st milennium it is far from being the safest.</p>
            <p>Another reason that space hulks are dangerous is the warp. No one knows what entities of the warp might have entered a space hulk before it translated back into normal space. And no one knows when a space hulk might suddenly be sucked back into the warp, so enter at your own risk.</p>
